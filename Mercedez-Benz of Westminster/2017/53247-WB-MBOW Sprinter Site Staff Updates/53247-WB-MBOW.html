                    <p class="lead">Sprinter Sales</p>
                    <p>Josh Richardson began his automotive career in 2007; he was looking for a change from the European professional basketball scene. After playing abroad for 5 years, he was getting tired of having to leave his family to report for training camp. Although his experience has been mainly in the domestic market, Josh has really come to appreciate what a luxury brand has to offer. "Mercedes-Benz has the best finish on their vehicles - hands down! It is hard to find anything wrong with the product." He started his career with Mercedes-Benz of Westminster in October of 2009 and says, "Neither of the two dealerships I worked for previously, cared about their customers the way that Mercedes-Benz of Westminster does."</p>
                    <p>Josh graduated from the University of Wyoming with a bachelor's degree in social work in 2003. When he was asked what he thinks it takes to be successful in the automotive industry he responded, "Be honest, be yourself, have fun with the customers. After all, buying a car should be fun - being that you will spend a lot of time in your vehicle."</p>

                <p>As early as I can remember, my family spent several hours in the garage cleaning and polishing the Trans Am for local car shows in Arizona. Weekend after weekend, from one show to the next, we displayed my Fathers pride and joy a 1981 Pontiac Trans-Am. I am the proud owner of that car today after 30 years.</p>

                <p>I was given the opportunity to work in the auto industry in 1996, directly out of hight school. I was seeking a career that would allow me to become independent. At that time, I had no idea it would become my life. Although I am new to Mercedes-Benz, my career started with a 15 year journey with General Motors. Many things have changed in the auto industry through the years; however, my passion for providing clients with exceptional service has not.</p>

                <p>If I have learned anything over the years it is that you never know what might be coming into the service drive. Every client that I meet face to face or on the phone is an opportunity. What I do know is the opportunities are endless. Every day you have the opportunity to make someone's day or correct problems.</p>

                <p>I feel that through my career I have accepted new challenges and I always want to move forward to new opportunities. Joining the Mercedes-Benz family, I have reached the pinnacle of the service industry. I enjoy the challenge and look forward to this new chapter in my career.</p>
